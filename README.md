Your task is to replicate the design of a website shown in the Figma link using HTML and CSS.


The website should have a header, an about section with three paragraphs, a categories section with cards arranged in a flexbox, and a footer containing a sitemap and social links.


You must use appropriate HTML elements and styling, and import the Poppins font from Google Fonts. The final UI should look exactly like the design in the Figma link.
